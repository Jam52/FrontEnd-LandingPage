        <p>I originally designed the orbit table for a compatition for handmade furniture in 2010. Unfortunatly I couldnt get a prototype put together in time however once we had it was clear that we had something special. </p>

        <p>The 'we' being refered to was myself and my farther, as once we had the manufacturing for the orbit figured out (with large steam boxes and precise jigs) we decided to go into business together and make and sell them!</p>

        <p>
          The main wooden rings are made using a steam bending and laminating technique. There are three layers of wood which are steamed for about 20 minutes in a large steam box. The hot lengths of wood are then quickly brought to a jig, bent and strapped to stay bent while they cool for about 24hrs.<br><br>The bent sections of wood are then cut to exactly half a circle with a specially designed jig. These perfect half circles are then laminated (glued in layers) with the joins offset to ensure the strength of the finished ring.<br><br>After the rings are cleaned up there is yet another set of specially designed jigs to drill the joining holes at a very specific position and angle. This is extremely important as otherwise the glass top once attached will not be flat<br><br>The last step is to uv bond the metal connectors to the glass, using the finished base to ensure the location is correct.
